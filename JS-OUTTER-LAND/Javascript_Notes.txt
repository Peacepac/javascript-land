*JavaScript Events*

An HTML event can be something the browser does, or something a user does.

Here are some examples of HTML events:

An HTML web page has finished loading
An HTML input field was changed
An HTML button was clicked
Often, when events happen, you may want to do something.

JavaScript lets you execute code when events are detected.

HTML allows event handler attributes, with JavaScript code, to be added to HTML elements.

With single quotes:

<element event='some JavaScript'>

In the following example, an onclick attribute (with code), is added to a <button> element:

Example
<button onclick="document.getElementById('demo').innerHTML = Date()">The time is?</button>


*JavaScript Strings*

JavaScript strings are for storing and manipulating text.

A JavaScript string is zero or more characters written inside quotes.

Example
let text = "John Doe";

*String Length*
To find the length of a string, use the built-in length property:

Example
let text = "ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ";
let length = text.length;

*String Methods and Properties*
Primitive values, like "John Doe", cannot have properties or methods (because they are not objects).

But with JavaScript, methods and properties are also available to primitive values, because JavaScript treats primitive values as objects when executing methods and properties.
